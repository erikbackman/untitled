* Dynamic scenes
:LOGBOOK:

  Added basic scene handling. Need to implement a way for geometry to depend on variables.
:END:
Uploading something like a sphere on every frame is very slow so for
now lets set up and upload the data once per scene with begin-scene
then renderer-present may be called on every frame. The question is,
how do we update the geometry?.

I could stick to static scenes for now and perhaps upload new data
whenever the scene changes which obviously shouldn't be done
frequently because then I'm back to essentially uploading every
frame. So in order to support a updating geometry often I think I
would need to handle these changes in the rendering pipeline.
